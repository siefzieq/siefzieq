# ðŸŽ¬ Welcome to Code with Hasif Zikry! ðŸŽ¥
Hey there, folks! Youâ€™re tuned in to the channel where coding meets creativity! Iâ€™m your host, Hasif Zikry, and today, weâ€™re diving deep into the world of Laravel, React, Machine Learning, and all things tech magic.

## ðŸ”§ On todayâ€™s episode:
ðŸš€ Project Spotlight: From my Gemini-like Mock System (think ChatGPT but Hasif-flavored) to a centralized monitoring system for urban farms, weâ€™re showcasing the builds that keep me coding into the night!

ðŸŽ“ What Iâ€™m currently learning: Weâ€™ll explore the cutting-edge stuff Iâ€™m masteringâ€”like Deep Learning and fine-tuning my KNN algorithms. Watch as I push my React skills to their limits.

ðŸ“Š Data Dive: Stay tuned as we break down my data analysis work, like that sweet Tableau dashboard tracking Malaysiaâ€™s rubber plantations. Yes, data can be that cool!

## ðŸ’¡ Languages and Framework:
